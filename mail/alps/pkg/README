Configuring HTTP access
=======================

By default alps serves HTTP requests on its own. It can also be
configured to run behind HTTP proxy like relayd(8) or nginx(8).

In every case, it needs to be told the upstream server. Assuming
SRV DNS records are properly set up:

    # rcctl set alps flags "example.com"

or to manually specify the servers:

    # rcctl set alps flags "imaps://mail.example.org smtps://mail.example.com"

Customizing alps
================

For custom public files and templates please use ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/www/alps
directory.
