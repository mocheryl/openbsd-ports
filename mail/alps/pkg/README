Configuring HTTP access
=======================

By default alps serves HTTP requests on its own. It can also be
configured to run behind HTTP proxy like relayd(8) or nginx(8).

Another option is to let OpenBSD httpd(8) serve HTTP(S) requests
and pass it to alps via FastCGI protocol.

In every case, it needs to be told the upstream server. Assuming
SRV DNS records are properly set up:

    # rcctl set alps flags "example.com"

or to manually specify the servers:

    # rcctl set alps flags "imaps://mail.example.org smtps://mail.example.com"


Example configuration for httpd(8) and alps communicating via FastCGI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Relevant configuration directives in /etc/httpd.conf:

	server "mail.example.org" {
		listen on * port http

		location "*" {
			fastcgi socket "/run/alps/alps.sock"
		}
	}

Create the directory for alps socket with the following command:

    # install -d -o www ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/www/run/alps

then set the flags so that it uses FastCGI:

    # rcctl set alps flags "-addr fcgi+unix://${LOCALSTATEDIR}/www/run/alps/alps.sock example.com"

Customizing alps
================

For custom public files and templates please use ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/www/alps
directory.
