To use filter-clamav, you must declare it in smtpd.

Edit the /etc/mail/smtpd.conf file to declare the filter:

  filter "clamav" proc-exec "filter-clamav"

Then add the filter to each listener that should be filtered:

  listen on socket filter "clamav" listen on all filter "clamav"

The filter itself does have some additional configurations, you can
look at them in filter-clamav(1) man page.
