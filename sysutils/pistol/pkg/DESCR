Pistol is a file previewer for command line file managers.

Pistol is a Go program (with (almost) 0 dependencies) and its MIME
type detection is internal. Moreover, it features native preview
support for almost any archive file and for text files along with
syntax highlighting.

In case Pistol encounters a MIME type it doesn't know how to handle
natively and you haven't configured a program to handle it, it'll
print a general description of the file type it encountered.
