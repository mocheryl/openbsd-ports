Pistol is a file previewer for command line file managers such as
Ranger, Lf and nnn, intended to replace the file previewer shell
script scope.sh commonly used with Ranger and other previewing
methods.

Pistol is a Go program (with (almost) 0 dependencies) and its MIME
type detection is internal. Moreover, it features native preview
support for almost any archive file and for text files along with
syntax highlighting while scope.sh relies on external programs to
do these basic tasks.

The following table lists Pistol's native previewing support:
- text/*: Prints text files with syntax highlighting thanks to
chroma.
- Archives: Prints the contents of archive files using archiver.

In case Pistol encounters a MIME type it doesn't know how to handle
natively and you haven't configured a program to handle it, it'll
print a general description of the file type it encountered. For
example, the preview for an executable might be: "ELF 64-bit LSB
executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2,
BuildID[sha1]=a34861a1ae5358dc1079bc239df9dfe4830a8403, for GNU/Linux
3.2.0, not stripped". This feature is available out of the box just
like the previews for the common mime types mentioned above.
