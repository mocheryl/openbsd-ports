Tokidoki is a (WIP) carddav and caldav server.

Tokidoki relies on go-webdav for the protocol implementation. It
provides the storage backend and authentication, both of which are
easily pluggable.

It currently provides:
Authentication:
- IMAP
- Static file (htpasswd)
- OAuth 2.0
Storage:
- Filesystem
