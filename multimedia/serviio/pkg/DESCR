Serviio is a free media server. It allows you to stream your media
files (music, video or images) to renderer devices (e.g. a TV set,
Bluray player, games console or mobile phone) on your connected
home network.

Serviio works with many devices from your connected home (TV,
Playstation 3, XBox 360, smart phones, tablets, etc.). It supports
profiles for particular devices so that it can be tuned to maximise
the device's potential and/or minimize lack of media format playback
support (via transcoding).
