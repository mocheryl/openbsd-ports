| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic setup
===========

Enable the service and add a path to the default configuration file:

	# rcctl enable stash
	# rcctl set stash flags --config /etc/stash/config.yml

Start the service:

	# rcctl start stash

By default it listens on port 9999 so just navigate your browser
to http://localhost:9999/

Usage
=====

First thing you might want to do is restrict access to the application
by creating an account. Go to "Setings -> Security -> Authentication
-> Credentials" and click "Edit" then set your username and password.

The port sets up folders "${LOCALSTATEDIR}/stash/images" and
"${LOCALSTATEDIR}/stash/videos" where you can upload images and
videos respectively, but you can define you own storage location(s)
in "Settings -> Library". After you have all your content placed
appropriately, you can start curating it after running the import
process with "Scan" button found in "Settings -> Tasks -> Library".

For additional information you may view the in-built manual.
