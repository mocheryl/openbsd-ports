FFMPEG
======

Stash requires that the installation of FFMPEG has WebP support
enabled. The one in the official ports doesn't come compiled with
it by default, so you will need to build and install a custom version
of it. In the makefile add the following parameters to the build
arguments:

- "webp" to "WANTLIB".
- "graphics/libwebp" to "LIB_DEPENDS".
- "-lwebp", "-lwebpdecoder", "-lwebpdemux", and "-lwebpmux" to
"LIBavcodec_EXTRALIBS".
- "--enable-libwebp" to "CONFIGURE_ARGS".

Don't forget to increment the revision. For more information please
see:

Basic setup
===========

Enable the service and add a path to the default configuration file:

	# rcctl enable stash
	# rcctl set stash flags --config /etc/stash/config.yml

Start the service:

	# rcctl start stash

By default it listens on port 9999 so just navigate your browser
to http://localhost:9999/

Usage
=====

First thing you might want to do is restrict access to the application
by creating an account. Go to "Setings -> Security -> Authentication
-> Credentials" and click "Edit" then set your username and password.

The port sets up folders "${LOCALSTATEDIR}/stash/images" and
"${LOCALSTATEDIR}/stash/videos" where you can upload images and
videos respectively, but you can define you own storage location(s)
in "Settings -> Library". After you have all your content placed
appropriately, you can start curating it after running the import
process with "Scan" button found in "Settings -> Tasks -> Library".

For additional information you may view the in-built manual.
