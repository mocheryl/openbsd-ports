Stash is a self-hosted webapp written in Go which organizes and serves
your porn.

Stash gathers information about videos in your collection from the
internet, and is extensible through the use of community-built plugins
for a large number of content producers and sites.

Stash supports a wide variety of both video and image formats.

You can tag videos and find them later.

Stash provides statistics about performers, tags, studios and more.
