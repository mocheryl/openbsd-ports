| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial configuration
=====================

By default forgejo listens on all configured IP addresses, TCP port
3000. If this is not wanted behavior, either adjust your pf(4) rules
or change HTTP_ADDR/HTTP_PORT in ${SYSCONFDIR}/forgejo/app.ini.

To complete the initial configuration, point your browser to
http://forgejo.example.com:3000 and press "Sign In". Usually you'll
need to configure SSH Server Domain/Port, Forgejo HTTP Listen
Port/Base URL, E-Mail Settings and Administrator Account Settings.

On OpenBSD, initial forgejo configuration has the following
restrictions:
- Self-Registration is disabled.
- Sign-In is required to view the content.
- E-Mail addresses are not shown.
- Server runs in "offline" mode, which means that external services
such as Gravatar/OpenID are not used.
- New repositories have "private" checkbox checked by default.

Adjust these configuration settings according to your requirements.

Customizing forgejo
===================

For custom public files, templates, gitignores, labels, licenses
and READMEs, please use ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/forgejo/custom directory.
