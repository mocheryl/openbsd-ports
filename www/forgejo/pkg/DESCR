Forgejo is a self-hosted lightweight version control software.

Forgejo provides the following:

- Lightweight: Forgejo can easily be hosted on nearly every machine.
Running on a Raspberry? Small cloud instance? No problem!
- Project management: Besides Git hosting, Forgejo offers issues,
pull requests, wikis, kanban boards and much more to coordinate
with your team.
- Publishing: Have something to share? Use releases to host your
software for download, or use the package registry to publish it
for docker, npm and many other package managers.
- Customizable: Want to change your look? Change some settings?
There are many config switches to make Forgejo work exactly like
you want.
- Powerful: Organizations & team permissions, CI integration, Code
Search, LDAP, OAuth and much more. If you have advanced needs,
Forgejo has you covered.
- Privacy: From update checker to default settings: Forgejo is built
to be privacy first for you and your crew.
- Federation: (WIP) We are actively working to connect software
forges with each other through ActivityPub, and create a collaborative
network of personal instances.
